# Movie-Soundtrack-Generator

## Description 

An application that converts the userâ€™s movie searches into the soundtrack allowing them to sample the songs. We accomplish this by using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript (JQuery), and fetching data from IMDb and Apple Music web APIs.

### Project Overview

* Personalized homepage with searchbar and linked favorites soundtrack and movies using the apis.
* Created a friendly user interface that is interactive when adjusting to different screen sizes and mobile view using media queries. 
* Styling was set in CSS and Bootstrap 
* Using the OMDB API, we can pull movie titles and results searched from the user, including artwork. 
* If there are multiple entries under the same title/series the movies are displayed for user selection. 
* We then use a function that pulls the movie soundtrack from the Apple Music API.
* Because Apple Music and OMDB use different character traits for the titles, we created a function that makes them lowercase.  
* The user searches are stored in the local storage and to be accessed later from the user and selected again. 
* The user also has the option to clear their storage history.
